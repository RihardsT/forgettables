### Run command in background
nohup COMMAND & # One option. Very good. This will keep the process running even when closing terminal.
# Also logs by default in nohup.out file. Great!
screen # Check this out
tmux # Also check this out. Multiple terminals from one screen

COMMAND & # & should be enough for running in background. Alive while terminal is alive?
jobs # check what's running in background
kill -SIGSTOP %1 # stop specific job
kill -SIGCONT %1 # continue specific job

# date. man date
date +%Y-%m-%d-%H.%M.%S

# Clam Antivirus
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y clamav
clamscan -r / # recursive scan probably.
clamscan -ro / # o to skip output of ok files


### Openssl
# Generate self signed cert. -nodes flag to not require passkey

# Check if hashes match between cert and key.
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in CERTIFICATE.crt | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in KEY_FILE.key | openssl md5

### Show sites SSL certificate
ENDPOINT=""
openssl s_client -connect $ENDPOINT:443 -servername $ENDPOINT
### Show SSL certificate expiration date
openssl s_client -connect $ENDPOINT:443 -servername $ENDPOINT < /dev/null 2>&1 | openssl x509 -enddate -noout
### Show SSL certificate file expiration date
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in FILE_NAME
### Show other stuff too
openssl x509 -text -in FILE_NAME

# p12 cert stuff
openssl pkcs12 -nokeys -in FILE_NAME | openssl x509 -text

### Sticky permissions to folders.
# This will ensure that files created there will be deleteable, modifyable by the set group.
# This is usefull, if root user is creating files there,
# thus preventing application user from modifying the files.
# No guarantees. Try this out.
mkdir FOLDER
chgrp GROUP_NAME FOLDER
chmod g+wrxs FOLDER # s for sticky
setfacl -d -m g::wrx FOLDER # -d default -m modify g::wrx group by defalt will have write, read, execute permissions

### ACL's - allow access to files even for users without belonging to specific group
# + is shown in ls -l if there's extended (ACL) permissions
getfacl
# -m modify
setfacl -m u:USER_ID_OR_NAME:rw FILE
setfacl -m m::r FILE # Set mask
setfacl -m m::- FILE # Remove all permissions with mask. -
setfacl -m g::rwx FILE # Without user, works like chmod?
# -d default -m modify - set default permissions on new files in subdirectories
setfacl -d -m u:USER_ID_OR_NAME:rwx DIRECTORY
getfacl DIRECTORY
setfacl -m u:USER_ID_OR_NAME:rwx DIRECTORY # change the acl of existing folder
setfacl -m u:USER_ID_OR_NAME:rwx,g:GROUP:rwx DIRECTORY # multiple permissions
# Remove acls on folder. Check help
setfacl --remove-default
setfacl -x d:u:USER_ID_OR_NAME DIRECTORY # remove specific ACL. Here defaults
setfacl -x u:USER_ID_OR_NAME DIRECTORY # remove specific ACL
# Copy ACL to another file
getfacl FILENAME1 | setfacl --set-file=- # - here means from stdin

###
# u - user/owner , g - group, o - other, - remove permissions, + add permissions
# r - read, w - write, x - execute
chmod ugo+X -R FOLDER # add execute permissions to folders only. X applies to folder. x also to files

chown :GROUP FILE_OR_FOLDER

#
setuid # whenever user executes file, it will be executed as user who owns the file
chmod u+s FILE_OR_FOLDER # set
chmod 4500 FILE_OR_FOLDER # 4 setuid for user, 2 setuid for group, 6 for user and group
# sticky bit - prevent unauthorized users to remove/rename file/folder.
chmod +t FILE_OR_FOLDER
chmod 1777 FILE_OR_FOLDER

# Set that all files created in folder are created with specified group
setgid
chown :GROUP FOLDER
chmod g+s FOLDER


### umask - mask privileges. Set default permissions for newly created files/folders
# changing umask persists only for current session
0022 #=output. masks nothing for user, masks write privileges for group and other
umask 006 # mask permissions for other, for newly created files
touch TESTFILE
ls -lah TESTFILE
# /etc/bashrc /etc/profile - edit umask here to update default permissions somewhat permanently


### Disk speed test with dd. You might want to change the output file size, bs=1M
# Write speed test
dd if=/dev/zero of=/PLACE_ON_SPECIFIC_DISK bs=1G count=1 conv=fdatasync
# Latency test
dd if=/dev/zero of=/PLACE_ON_SPECIFIC_DISK bs=512 count=1000 oflag=dsync
# oflag=dsync -- To get rid of caching for more precise results


### Quickly create a big file
fallocate -l 10G FILE

### Time tic toc. Show how long a command or script took to execute
time COMMAND

### Check limits for each process
cat /proc/<PID>/limits

### yes to interactive promts. yes Y. Useful whenever
yes STRING_HERE | COMMAND
yes | COMMAND

### Write multiline file from terminal. EOM is the delimiter
cat > FILE <<- EOM
FILE_CONTENTS_GO_RIGHT_HERE
EOM
# Use \EOM when the one above gives ": bad substition" error
cat > FILE <<\EOM
FILE_CONTENTS_GO_RIGHT_HERE_WITH_QUOTES_OR_WHATEVER
EOM

##### Shutdown, reboot
# Shutdown in 5 minutes
shutdown -r +5 Message for other users on the machine
shutdown -c # cancel reboot
shutdown -r 00:00 # at hh:mm
shutdown -H now # halt know
shutdown -P now # poweroff

### Set process priority
# -20 to 19. -20 = highest priority, 19 = lowest priority, very nice process
nice -n 0 PROCESS # start process with niceness of 0
renice -n 10 $(pgrep PATTERN) # change priority of multiple processes

##
cat /proc/cpuinfo

### Sudoers - passwordless
USERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

### Get rid of extension. String slicing etc?
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html
FILE="FILENAME"
echo "${FILE%%EXT}"
echo "${FILE%%.jar}"
EXTENSION=".jar"
echo "${FILE%%${EXTENSON}}"

### SSH

# copy ssh public key to server
ssh-copy-id USER@IP

# Add key for the session, so it doesn't ask passphrase for each ssh command
ssh-agent bash
ssh-add

# List loaded keys
ssh-add -l
# Load keys
echo "IdentityFile ~/.ssh/KEYNAME" >> ~/.ssh/config

### Logger
logger "Write something to system logs"
# Log can be seen then in journalctl
journalctl -f
# Delete old journal
sudo journalctl --rotate
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2d
# Configure journalctl
vi /etc/systemd/journald.conf
  SystemMaxUse=100M
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
